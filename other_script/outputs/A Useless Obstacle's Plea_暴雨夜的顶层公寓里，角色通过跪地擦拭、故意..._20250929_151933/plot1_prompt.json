A woman is on all fours on the glossy black floor, wearing a short, clinging black silk slip dress that is translucent from moisture. She gazes upwards directly into the lens, her face flushed, eyes wide with a mixture of fear and lust, and her lips are slightly parted. She slightly raises her hips. The composition is a dramatic low-angle view, making her appear submissive. The camera uses a wide aperture, creating a shallow depth of field that renders her body in sharp focus while the background city lights are blurred.
